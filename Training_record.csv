10/4/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Result_10_4,"train with constraind range activation, MAE loss, without dropout, without cGAN fine tune",canceled
10/4/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Result_10_4_small,"same as above, but using 64G memory to see if it works and run faster",不好
10/4/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_4_3,train 5 epochs max,最高0.5， 但普遍不好
10/5/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_5_1,"add normalization to elevation, days, train 1 epochs, added bias and initialization to model",不好
10/5/2-22,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_5_2,"add normalization to elevation, days, train 1 epochs, added bias and initialization to model, nnelu activation",不好
10/6/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_6_1,"MAE, constraint activation， epochs 5，callback, n_lag15, n_pred1, taskdim(8,8), with cGAN","best 0.7, not good in general"
10/9/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_9_1,"train with smaller area, taskdim(5,5), MAE, constraint activation， epochs 5，callback, n_lag15, n_pred1, without Cgan",不好
10/9/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_9_2,"taskdim(10, 10)",比1好点
10/9/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_9_3,"taskdim(15, 15), small training, epochs 20",出现很多1
10/9/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_9_4,"same as 3, but more complex model","training time too long, canceled"
10/10/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_10_1,"small area, task (3, 3), with cGAN",error
10/10/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_10_2,"small area, task (5, 5), with cGAN",不好
10/11/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_11_1,"small area, (5, 5), with cGAN, LSTM return sequence, reduce memory to 16G",
10/12/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_12_1,"found a data processing error, fixed, traing with 120*130 area, task dim (5, 5), 5 epochs, stride 2, n_lag 20, n_pred1, with Cgan",结果不好，换成nnelu，
10/13/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_13_1,"lag20, task dim (3, 3), nnelu activation, all country, optimization error: delete dropout",S1结果不错，其他结果将就
10/18/2022,/scratch1/menglinw/Results/10_18_1,"train AFG and other separately, with overlapping, with mix training","found one error, used all data for non-AFG training, but check anyway"
